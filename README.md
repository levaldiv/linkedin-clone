# LinkedIn Clone

This LinkedIn clone is a basic clone of the actual [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com). </br>
This is also my third clone created using Tailwind and other amazing tools. <br>

Note: Check out the deployed version [here](https://linkedin-clone-ashen.vercel.app).

## Notes:

I had a fun time cloning Twitter and learned more about Tailwind, NextAuth, MongoDb, etc. This also has a fully working dark mode toggle. It changes to whatever the user toggles it to. As expected there may/may not be some bugs. As I am still understanding web development. For now, I will leave as is and in the future I will add more fun stuff and make it more interative. <br>

To logout, just click on the avatar above your name or the avatar to the right next to work.
